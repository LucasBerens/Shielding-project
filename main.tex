\section{Introduction}
\section{LINAC Primary and Secondary Barriers}
    \subsection{Controlled and uncontrolled areas}
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/controlled areas.png}
        \caption{Controlled and uncontrolled areas for the radiation therapy treatment center}
        \label{controll}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Occupancy factor (T) for each room}
    
    \subsection{If this clinic treats 25 patients a day, each getting 225\hspace{0.85pt}cGy at ISO, calculate the facility's weekly workload.}
    Workload is simply the total dose delivered per week, for all patients, and can be calculated as the product of the number of days per week $Y$, the number of patients treated $N$, and the absorbed dose per patient $D$:
    \begin{align}
        W &= YND.
    \end{align}
    In our case we have the clinical operating for 5 days a week, 25 patients per day, and \SI{2.25}{Gy/patient}. This gives a workload of $W = \SI{281.25}{Gy/wk}$. 
    
    \subsection{Identify the primary barriers.}
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/barriers.png}
        \caption{Primary and secondary barriers inside the LINAC vault. }
        \label{barriers}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Work out the use factor (U) for each wall in the vault.}
    The wall to the east is slightly thicker than the wall to the west, which implies WBI treatment gantry rotation is to the opposite side of the wall. Dr. Ebrahimi stated that we should account for TBI having a higher dose since the distance is farther, but above he states that each patient receives the same dose. Therefore, we calculate the use factor $\mathrm{U_L}$ for the eastern (E) and western (W) walls separately, by summing the the 
    \begin{align*}
        \mathrm{U_E} &= \\
        \mathrm{U_W} &= 
    \end{align*}

    \subsection{Find the attenuation (1-transmission) factor for the primary barriers}
    The attenuation/barrier transmission factor can be calculated as
    \begin{align}
        B = \frac{Pd^2}{WTU}
    \end{align}
    where $P = \qty{0.1}{mSv/wk}$ is the dose allowed in this  area, or $P = \qty{0.1}{mSv/week}$ $d$ is the distance from the source to the wall, $W$ is the workload calculated earlier, $T$ is the occupancy factor, and $U$ is the use factor. $d$ was calculated as \qty{5}{m} plus  For the eastern and western walls we have (assuming \qty{1}{Gy} = \qty{1}{Sv}),
    \begin{align*}
        B_\mathrm{L} &=  \frac{\left( \qty{0.0001}{Sv/wk} \right)\left( \qty{5.3}{m^2} \right)}{\left( \qty{281.25}{Gy/wk} \right)\left( 0.5 \right)\left( 0.35 \right)} \\
        &= \SI{5.71e-5}{m^2} \\ \\ 
        B_\mathrm{R} &=  \frac{\left( \qty{0.0001}{Sv/wk} \right)\left( \qty{5.3}{m^2} \right)}{\left( \qty{281.25}{Gy/wk} \right)\left( 0.5 \right)\left( 0.45 \right)} \\
        &= \SI{4.44e-5}{m^2}       
    \end{align*}
    
    
\section{LINAC Maze and CT Simulation}
    In general, approximations were done as such that the numerator was overestimated and the denominator was underestimated. Note these values were calculated with W = 300 Gy/wk, but this does not account for an increased contribution of TBI to this measurement. Based on this, W is roughly 1000 Gy/wk. This would apply a multiplier of 3.33 to all our dose calculations. To account for this, we would have to increase the thickness of the maze wall to decrease $\mathrm{H_{LT}}$ (direct leakage through maze wall) in the same way as shown below. The general calculation accounts for four sources of radiation and then multiplies the sum of these four sources by an empirical factor.
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Dose equivalent } \mathrm{H_{tot}} &=  2.6\left[\text{wall scatter + patient scatter + leakage scatter + direct leakage} \right]\\
        &= 2.6 \mathrm{H_G} \\
        &= 2.6 \left[\mathrm{H_S + H_{PS} + H_{LS} + H_{LT}} \right]
    \end{align*}

    For wall scatter:
    
    \begin{align*}
        \mathrm{H_S} &= \frac{(\SI{300}{Gy/wk})(0.35)(.02)(\qty{.8}{m^2})(0.005)(\qty{8.8}{m^2})}{\left[(\qty{2.5}{m})(\qty{5}{m})(\qty{5}{m})\right]^2} \\
         &= \SI{6.1e-5}{Sv/wk}
    \end{align*}

    
    \subsection{Problem Description and Assumptions}
        A $\SI{350}{mm} \times \SI{350}{mm}$ CT sim control room is adjacent to a $\SI{700}{mm} \times \SI{550}{mm}$ CT sim vault. Workload and CT specifications are depicted in Table \ref{CT_spec}. Considering the facility is on a single level, floor and ceiling shielding is not required. Additionally, we assume the facility is not in proximity to any sidewalks with pedestrian traffic, negating the need for external wall shielding. The only remaining walls to consider is that adjacent to the LINAC room and the sim vault.
        
        Because the LINAC room already has shielding in place capable of protecting against therapeutic-level scattered radiation, these measures will far surpass any dose from the CT which primarily outputs only scattered and leakage (secondary) radiation from gamma beams of \SI{80}{keV} or \SI{140}{keV}. Therefore, the only wall requiring shielding is the wall adjacent to the CT sim room. It is worth mentioning that there is a storage room on the same wall as the sim room, but given that this room is rarely occupied and only for very short periods at a time, shielding is not required here. The following calculations estimate the required shielding thickness for the CT sim room following the CTDI method described in the NCRA Report 147 \cite{national2004ncrp}.

    \subsection{Secondary Air-Kerma Values per Patient at 1\hspace{0.85pt}m}
        NCRP defines the secondary air-kerma value per patient at \SI{1}{m} ($K^1\mathrm{_{sec}}$) by
        \begin{align} \label{k_patient}
                K^1\mathrm{_{sec}} = \left(\kappa\right) \left( \frac{L}{P}\right) \left(\mathrm{mAs}\right) \left(_n\mathrm{CTDI}_{100}\right)
        \end{align}
        where $\kappa$ is the scatter fraction per centimeter, $L$ is the imaging length, and $P$ is pitch. $\kappa$ values for body and head CTs provided by the NCRP are $\kappa\mathrm{_{body}} = \SI{3e-4}{\per \cm}$ and $\kappa\mathrm{_{head}} = \SI{9e-5}{\per \cm}$, respectively.  

        In the case of the missing $_n\mathrm{CTDI}_{100}$ value for head scans (see Table \ref{CT_spec}), we take the reference value provided in the NCRP report and assume $_n\mathrm{CTDI}_{100}\text{(Head)} = \qty[mode = text]{0.223}{mGy.mAs^{-1}}$. Because the calculation is more heavily dependent on the $\kappa\mathrm{_{body}}$ value which is larger than $\kappa\mathrm{_{head}}$ by an order of magnitude, this assumption is justified. Substituting values for body or head CTs from Table \ref{CT_spec}, the following $ K^1\mathrm{_{sec}}$ values are obtained:
        \begin{align*}
            K^1\mathrm{_{sec}(Body)} &= \left(\SI{3e-4}{\per \cm}\right)\left(\frac{\SI{50}{cm}}{1.3}\right)(\SI{350}{mAs})\left(\qty[mode = text]{0.14}{mGy.mAs^{-1}.patient^{-1}}\right) \\
            &= \SI{0.5654}{mGy/patient}\\
            K^1\mathrm{_{sec}(Head)} &= \left(\SI{9e-5}{\per \cm}\right)\left(\frac{\SI{20}{cm}}{1}\right)(\SI{200}{mAs})\left(\qty[mode = text]{0.223}{mGy.mAs^{-1}.patient^{-1}}\right) \\
            &= \SI{0.0803}{mGy/patient}
        \end{align*}

    \subsection{Total Secondary Air-Kerma Value at 3\hspace{0.85pt}m}
        Given 50\% of body CT patients required a CT scan, the total number of body CT patients is $n\mathrm{_{body}} = 50\cdot0.5 = 25$. Because a percent requiring scan value is not given for head patients, we consider the maximum possible dose case according to ALARA principles and assume 100\% of head CT patients require a scan ($n\mathrm{_{head}} = 10$). Therefore, the total secondary air-kerma value at a distance $d$ away from the shielding wall, accounting for the upper limit workload from both body and head scans and the inverse square law, is shown in Equation (\ref{k_total}). 

        \begin{equation}\label{k_total}
            K\mathrm{_{sec}} = \left(\frac{\qty{1}{m}}{d}\right)^2 [n\mathrm{_{body}}\cdot K^1\mathrm{_{sec}(Body)}) + n\mathrm{_{head}}\cdot K^1\mathrm{_{sec}(Head)}]
        \end{equation}
        
        From the floor plan, it can be seen that the isocenter of the CT is roughly 3 m from the surface of the sim wall. Substituting values and solving: 
        \begin{align*}
            K\mathrm{_{sec}} &= \left(\frac{\qty{1}{m}}{\qty{3}{m}}\right)^2\left[\left(\qty{25}{\frac{patients}{week}}\right)\left(\SI{0.05654}{\frac{mGy}{patient}}\right)+ \left(\qty{10}{\frac{patients}{week}}\right)\left(\SI{0.0803}{\frac{mGy}{patient}}\right)\right]\\
            &= \SI{1.66}{mGy/week}
        \end{align*}
        
    \subsection{Required Shielding Thickness}
            According to ICRP guidance, the annual occupational dose limit is \qty{50}{mGy/year}. Assuming a 40 week work year, the weekly dose limit for workers in the CT sim control room $\frac{\qty{50}{mGy/year}}{\qty{40}{week/year}}$ = \qty{1.25}{mGy/week}. We assume the sim room is a controlled area (no public access), and restricted to radiation workers only. Therefore, the required barrier transmission is calculated as:
        \begin{equation*}
            B = \frac{\qty{1.25}{mGy/week}}{\qty{1.66}{mGy/week}} = 0.7531
        \end{equation*}
        
        Substituting $B$ into Equation A.3 in Appendix 2 of NCRP 147 using the fit parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ provided for lead shielding of \qty{140}{kVp} CT scanners, the required barrier lead thickness $x\mathrm{_{lead}}$ is calculated as:
        
        \begin{align*}
            x\mathrm{_{lead}} &= \frac{1}{\alpha\gamma}\ln\left(\frac{B^{-\gamma}+\frac{\beta}{\alpha}}{1+ \frac{\beta}{\alpha}} \right)\\
            x\mathrm{_{lead}} &= \frac{1}{\qty{2.009}{mm^{-1}}\cdot0.342}\ln\left(\frac{( 0.7531)^{-0.342}+\frac{\qty{3.99}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{2.009}{mm^{-1}}}}{1+ \frac{\qty{3.99}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{2.009}{mm^{-1}}}} \right)\\
            &= \qty{0.05}{mm}
        \end{align*}
        
        Similarly, by substituting fit parameters for concrete shielding of 140 kVp CT scanners, the required barrier lead thickness $x\mathrm{_{concrete}}$ is calculated as:
        \begin{align*}
            x\mathrm{_{concrete}} &= \frac{1}{\qty{0.0336}{mm^{-1}}\cdot0.519}\ln\left(\frac{( 0.7531)^{-0.519}+\frac{\qty{0.0122}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{0.0336}{mm^{-1}}}}{1+ \frac{\qty{0.0122}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{0.0336}{mm^{-1}}}} \right)\\
            &= \qty{6.31}{mm}
        \end{align*}
        
        Therefore, according to the CTDI method, the required shielding for the CT sim room is \SI{0.05}{mm} lead, or equivalently, \SI{6.31}{mm} concrete. Since \SI{0.05}{mm} lead is much less than the 1.59 mm lead thickness standard, \SI{1.59}{mm} shielding is confirmed to be a safe and appropriate barrier for the CT sim room barrier.
        
    \subsection{DLP Calculation Check} 
        NCRP 147 also provides a secondary CT shielding calculation based on dose length product (DLP) values. The method is similar to CTDI in all but the $K^1\mathrm{_{sec}}$ calculation which is defined according to Equation (\ref{DLP}) where the DLP values are \SI{550}{mGy.cm} and \SI{1200}{mGy.cm}, for body and head CT scans, respectively (NCRP 147, Table 5.2 \cite{national2004ncrp}).
        \begin{align}\label{DLP}
            K^1\mathrm{_{sec}({Body})} &= 1.2 \cdot \kappa\mathrm{_{body}} \cdot \mathrm{DLP}\\
            K^1\mathrm{_{sec}(Head)} &= \kappa\mathrm{_{body}}\cdot \mathrm{DLP}
        \end{align}
        
        Following the methodology outlined in earlier sections and substituting in known values, the required barrier thicknesses via DLP is calculated as follows. 
        \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned} \nonumber
            K^1\mathrm{_{sec}({Body})} &= 1.2 \left(3 \times 10^{-4}\right) (550) \\
            &= \qty{0.1980}{mGy/patient}\\ \\
            K^1\mathrm{_{sec}({Head})} &= \left(9 \times 10^{-5} \right) (1200) \\
            &= \qty{0.1080}{mGy/patient}\\ \\
            \implies K\mathrm{_{sec}} &= \left(\frac{\qty{1}{m}}{\qty{3}{m}}\right)^2  \left[ \left( \qty{25}{\frac{patients}{week}}\right)\left(\SI{0.1980}{\frac{mGy}{patient}}\right)+ \right.\\
            & \hspace{63.25pt} \left.\left(  \qty{10}{\frac{patients}{week}}\right)\left(\SI{0.1080}{\frac{mGy}{patient}}\right) \right]\\
            &= \qty{6.14}{mGy/week}\\ \\
            \implies B &= \frac{\qty{1.25}{mGy/week}}{\qty{6.14}{mGy/week}} \\
            &= 0.2035
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        
        
        \begin{align*}
            x\mathrm{_{lead}} &= \frac{1}{\qty{2.009}{mm^{-1}}\cdot0.342}\ln\left(\frac{( 0.2035)^{-0.342}+\frac{\qty{3.99}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{2.009}{mm^{-1}}}}{1+ \frac{\qty{3.99}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{2.009}{mm^{-1}}}} \right) = \qty{0.32}{mm}\\
            x\mathrm{_{concrete}} &= \frac{1}{\qty{0.0336}{mm^{-1}}\cdot0.519}\ln\left(\frac{( 0.2035)^{-0.519}+\frac{\qty{0.0122}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{0.0336}{mm^{-1}}}}{1+ \frac{\qty{0.0122}{mm^{-1}}}{\qty{0.0336}{mm^{-1}}}} \right) = \qty{38.07}{mm}
        \end{align*}
        
        It can be seen that the DLP method results in a higher total secondary air-kerma estimate of 6.14 mGy/week compared to the $_n\mathrm{CTDI}_{100}$ method estimation of \qty{1.66}{mGy/week}. Even with this factor of $\sim$4 difference, the conservative DLP method still results in a lead thickness of only \qty{0.32}{mm} (or \qty{38.07}{mm} concrete thickness) which is smaller than the shielding standard of \qty{0.59}{mm}. This calculation confirms the CTDI result that standard shielding practices utilizing a \qty{0.59}{mm} lead barrier are appropriate for the CT sim room investigated. 

\section{Brachytherapy Room and Maze}
    \subsection{Does the decrease in activity from \SI{10}{Ci} to \SI{5}{Ci} impact the workload of treating 20 patients per week, with an average treatment time of 5 minutes per patient, using the new source?}
    We calculate the workload using
    \begin{align}
        W &= f A \Gamma_x t_w,
    \end{align}
    where $W$ is the workload, $f = \qty{1}{cGy/R.m^2}$ and relates R to cGy, $A$ is the source strength/activity, $\Gamma_x = \SI{0.48}{R.m^2/Ci.hr}$ is the exposure rate constant for $^{192}\mathrm{Ir}$, and $t_w = \left( \qty{20}{patients/week} \right)\left(\qty{5}{min}\right) = \qty{1.67}{hr}$ is the integrated treatment time per week for all patients. For a source strength of \SI{10}{Ci}, we have,
    \begin{align*}
        W &= \left(\qty{1}{cGy/R.m^2}\right)(\left( \SI{10}{Ci} \right) \left( \SI{0.48}{R.m^2/Ci.hr} \right) \left( \qty{1.67}{hr/week} \right) \\
        &= \qty{8.00}{cGy/week}.
    \end{align*}
    Now, we assume that the transmission through the patient is 20\%, giving a total workload of \qty{1.60}{cGy/week}. With $A = \SI{5}{Ci}$, this is halved to be $W = \qty{0.80}{cGy/week}$, however a lower source activity also means that treatment times are longer to deliver the same patient dose, so the workload would not actually change.

    \subsection{Determine the necessary lead shielding for all barriers.}
    Here we again use the barrier transmission factor $B$,
    \begin{align}
        B = \frac{Pd^2}{WTU},
    \end{align}
    where $P = \qty{0.02}{mSv/week}$ is the dose allowed in the room for an uncontrolled area, or $P = \qty{0.1}{mSv/week}$ $d$ is the distance from the source to the wall, $W$ is the workload calculated earlier, $T$ is the occupancy factor, and $U$ is the use factor. We consider here the north (N), east (E), south (S), and western (W) walls with distances from the source of $d_\mathrm{N} = \qty{1.5}{m}$, $d_\mathrm{E} = \qty{1.0}{m}$, $d_\mathrm{S} = \qty{4.5}{m}$, $d_\mathrm{W} = \qty{3.75}{m}$. $B_i$ is then:
    \begin{align*}
        B_{\mathrm{N}} &= \frac{\left(\qty{0.01}{cGy/week}\right)\left(\qty{1.5}{m}\right)^2}{\left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/week}\right)\left(1.0\right)\left( 1 \right)}\\
        &= \qty{0.141}{m^2} \\ \\
        B_{\mathrm{E}} &= \frac{\left(\qty{0.002}{cGy/week}\right)\left(\qty{1.0}{m}\right)^2}{\left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/week}\right)\left(0.25\right)\left( 1 \right)}\\
        &= \qty{0.005}{m^2} \\ \\ 
        B_{\mathrm{S}} &= \frac{\left(\qty{0.002}{cGy/week}\right)\left(\qty{4.5}{m}\right)^2}{\left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/week}\right)\left(0.50\right)\left( 1 \right)}\\
        &= \qty{0.506}{m^2} \\ \\ 
        B_{\mathrm{W}} &= \frac{\left(\qty{0.01}{cGy/week}\right)\left(\qty{3.75}{m}\right)^2}{\left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/week}\right)\left(0.50\right)\left( 1 \right)}\\
        &= \qty{0.176}{m^2} \\ \\ 
    \end{align*}
    Now we simply find the thickness of the required lead via Figure 11, taken from the NCRP 49 report \cite{simmons1978structural}. We find that the thicknesses of lead, $T_{i}$, for each wall are $T_\mathrm{N} = \qty{3.6}{cm}$, $T_\mathrm{E} = \qty{2.4}{cm}$, $T_\mathrm{S} = \qty{1.4}{cm}$, $T_\mathrm{W} = \qty{1.8}{cm}$. The western side of the maze, however, will have shielding for the LINAC, which is thicker than the required amount for brachytherapy.

    \subsection{Determine the length of the maze wall needed such that a door is unnecessary.}
        We begin by determining the thickness of the maze walls. In the previous section, it was determined that the western wall would be \qty{1.8}{cm} thick with lead shielding. Since the maze needs oblique distance calculations, we recalculate $B$ for the new distance, being from the X in the room, to the centerline of the maze, along a perpendicular line with the wall of the control room (see Figure \ref{brachy}). We also consider only patient scatter, and transmission through the maze wall. This gives a simplified expression for the total dose per week at the entrance of the maze:
        \begin{align} \label{bigboy}
            \mathrm{H_{tot}} &= \mathrm{H_{PS}} + \mathrm{H_{LT}} \\
            &=\frac{a(\theta)WU_G \left(F/400\right)\alpha_1 A_1}{\left( d_\mathrm{sca}d_\mathrm{sec}d_\mathrm{zz} \right)^2} + \frac{L_f W U_G B}{d_L^2}, \nonumber
        \end{align}
        where $a(\theta)$ is the scatter fraction for patient-scattered radiation at a given angle, $W$ is the workload, $U_G$ is the use factor, $F$ is the area of the beam at \qty{1}{m} from the patient, $\alpha_1$ is the wall reflection coefficient, $A_1$ is the area of the maze wall cross-section, $d_\mathrm{sca}, d_\mathrm{sec}, d_\mathrm{zz}$ are the distances from the target to the patient, patient to maze wall at the centerline, and total maze distance, respectively. $L_f$ is the head-leakage ratio, $B$ is the new barrier transmission factor, and $d_L$ is the distance for that new barrier transmission factor. 

        $a(\theta)$ was assumed to be 0.2 in accordance with the given assumptions, $W=\qty{1.60}{cGy/wk}$ as before, $U_G = 1$, $F$ was assumed to be the area of the steradian at $\qty{0.1}{m}$ from the patient in the direction of the maze, which was $F = \qty{100}{cm^2}$. \qty{0.1}{m} was chosen for this distance as it was assumed to be the approximate distance from the source to outside the patient. $\alpha_1 = 0.01$ from the given assumptions, $A_1 = (\SI{1.75}{m})(\qty{3.048}{m})$ since the maze width was \qty{1.75}{m}, and the ceiling height was assumed to be \qty{10}{ft}, or \qty{3.048}{m}. $L_f$ was assumed to 0.1\%, and $B$ was calculated as,
        \begin{align}
            B = \frac{\left(\qty{0.02}{cGy/week}\right)\left(d_L\right)^2}{\left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/week}\right)\left(0.5\right)\left( 1 \right)}.
        \end{align}
        Next, $d_\mathrm{sca} = \qty{0.1}{m}$ from our source-to-air assumption, and from Figure \ref{brachy}, $d_\mathrm{sec} = \qty{5.34}{m}$, and $d_\mathrm{zz} = \qty{4.5}{m} + x$, and $d_L = \sqrt{x^2+\left(2+\frac{1.75}{2}\right)^2}$. Plugging all factors into Equation \ref{bigboy}, we have
        \begin{align}
            \mathrm{H_{tot}} =&\frac{\left(0.2\right) \left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/wk}\right)\left(1\right) \left(\frac{\qty{100}{cm^2}}{400}\right)\left(0.01\right) \left((\SI{1.75}{m})(\qty{3.048}{m})\right)}{\left( \left(\qty{0.1}{m}\right)\left(\qty{5.34}{m}\right)\left(\qty{4.5}{m} + x\right) \right)^2} + \nonumber \\ 
            &\frac{\left(0.1/100\right) \left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/wk}\right) \left(1\right) \left( \frac{\left(\qty{0.02}{cGy/week}\right)\left(d_L\right)^2}{\left(\qty{1.60}{cGy/week}\right)\left(0.5\right)\left( 1 \right)} \right)}{d_L^2}. \nonumber
        \end{align}
        Solving for $x$ gives the result of \qty{4.167}{m}, which is the unknown length added to the known $\qty{4.5}{m}$. Therefore the total length of the maze must be at minimum $\qty{8.67}{m}$, or about $\qty{28.5}{ft}$.
